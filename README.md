#  Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI), often paired with Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), is a development pattern to rapidly deliver consistent working software. The basic principle is to always keep your project in a working state, with small incremental changes. The project should be monitored with automated tests and performance instrumentation. When code is pushed to the central repository, a build system will run the automated tests. If the tests pass, the code is ready to be reviewed and then deployed.
